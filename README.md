  - When I first saw this assignemnt to update our portfolio, I thought to myself, oh, this would be a fun time to remake my portfolio site given all that i know now compared to the first time around. With bootstrap this will be quick easy and free! Well, it turns out I underestimated what it would take to get everything reactive to screen sizes and phones, let alone to fully remake everything, but I was in too deep at that point so I had to commit. *sigh*

  - I only ended up using bootstrap for column dimentions and breakpoints, but I think even just for this, it probably saved me hours trying to get those correct as well. 

  - Shoutout to my roomate for showing me position: sticky. However, this certainly led me down a rabbit-hole of debugging for my header. Thankfully I am pretty happy with how it turned out overall, apart from some irregular displays and some missing functionality I would have liked, such as it remaining in its collapsed form when you start scrolling up from the bottom.

  - God bless margin: auto.

  - There are a few bugs and features that I couldnt get to at the time, and since I am reformatting all of my readmes, I'll breifly list them here since I'll be deleting those sections: Some bugs with phone display plus general bugs with my display:sticky header. better fonts/sizing. actually add my resume (spoiler alert, portfolio 3.0 has that!)
